# Heart-Disease-prediction
Heart Disease prediction using various ML models and finally well comparison is done.
Main objective is to predict whether a patient having heart disease or not.
This project is based on the prediction problem in which we have to predict whether the person having heart disease or not by using various ML models. After the Model Building, evaluation is also done and finally a conclusion has been made that which model best suites our dataset.
Various ML models like Logistic Regression,k-Nearest neighbor,Support Vector Machine is used and evaluated.
Data wrangling,Data Visualization,Data Scaling,Model Building and Model evaluation is done.

As a conclusion, K-Nearest Neighbor is the best fit model with 87% accuracy rate
